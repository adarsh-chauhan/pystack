# PyStack
POC to demonstrate Openstack(ocata) APIs through Django Web App

This project was created with the main objective to quickly deploy a VM and save times of a Network Engineer or any other NOC engineer who needs a Virtual machine as per his requirement without knowing the background processes of OpenStack.
